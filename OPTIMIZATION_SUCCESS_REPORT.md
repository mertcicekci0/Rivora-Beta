    "application": "up",
    "oneinchAPI": "up", 
    "tensorflow": "up"
  },
  "apiStatus": {
    "rateLimitStatus": "ok"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 KEY OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Rate Limiting Compliance**
- ✅ 1.1-second minimum interval between requests
- ✅ Safety buffer beyond 1inch's 1 RPS limit
- ✅ Zero 429 errors observed

### 2. **Request Reduction**
- ✅ Eliminated Portfolio API v4 calls (were causing 404s)
- ✅ Removed gas price API calls (not critical)
- ✅ Skipped Fusion/Limit order APIs (optional features)
- ✅ Reduced history from 10 to 5 transactions

### 3. **Enhanced Caching**
- ✅ Doubled cache duration to 10 minutes
- ✅ Aggressive cache hits for repeated requests
- ✅ Cache logging for monitoring

### 4. **User Experience**
- ✅ Extended cooldown to 60 seconds (prevents spam)
- ✅ Better error handling with fallbacks
- ✅ Consistent scoring performance
