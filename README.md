# Rivora-Beta

During the initial days of the hackathon, which started on July 25th, I experimented with different architectures and test scenarios in my previous repository to determine the most suitable file structure and development approach for the project. Following this phase of preliminary analysis and prototyping, I decided to create a new repository as of July 29th in order to proceed with a more sustainable and scalable architecture.

This README.md file will be updated as the project progresses.
